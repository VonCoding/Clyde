# ðŸ¤– Clyde

Clyde is your low-key, high-context AI dev assistant â€” designed for builders who live inside the terminal and thrive in Discord.

He speaks code fluently, responds fast, and plays nice with long conversations. Whether you're debugging on a coffee break or brainstorming a stack for your next side project, Clydeâ€™s always ready.

## ðŸ§  Under the Hood

Clyde runs on a member of the LLaMA 3.1 family â€” a next-gen multilingual model with a 128K context window, advanced tool use, and stronger reasoning capabilities.

This enables Clyde to:
- Summarize long threads or code blocks
- Understand programming context deeply
- Generate and explain working code
- Hold natural, ongoing dev conversations  
- **Remember the last 10 messages** for context-aware replies, allowing multi-step debugging or iterative improvements as long as the original code is still in recent memory
